Should be pretty obvious, place your files in whichever folder you need them to be in. You must press Rescan Custom Content if you change any files while the game is already running for the changes to be seen.

If you have a video background set, it will override any image background you have set. If a song folder has a video inside it (they must be named 'video') that will override both image and video backgrounds.

Image backgrounds and highways can either be JPG or PNG files.

To choose a highway, press Start to enter the profile options and scroll down to the Highway setting and choose it there.
To choose backgrounds, go into the Custom Content menu in the Settings menu.

On Windows, video backgrounds can be MP4, AVI, WEBM, VP8, OGV, and MPEG format.
On Linux, video backgrounds can be WEBM, VP8, and OGV (low format amount is a Linux thing I think, nothing I can really do about it right now)

Older hardware may not be able to play videos at all, which is a hardware problem and not a problem with Unity or CH. If videos just don't work, then that is probably why. Please remove all videos if this is the case, as Unity will constantly write errors every frame to an internal log and may slow down performance.
